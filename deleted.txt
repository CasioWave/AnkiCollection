1671362638671	1656929491595	What is biological species?	A group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce fertile offspring.
1671362683939	1656929491595	What is speciation?	It is the process ny which one species splits into two or more species.
1671362761670	1656929491595	What is the basic thing that needs to happen for speciation to occur?	A key even tin the origin of a new species is the separation of a population from other populations of the same species.
1671362822555	1656929491595	What are the names of the four kinds of speciation?	1. Allopatric<br>2. Sympatric<br>3. Peripatric<br>4. Parapatric
1671363207498	1656929491595	A large lake has dried up, and has split into smaller lakes. What is th type of speciation that will happen here?	Allopatric Speciation
1671363278327	1656929491595	What is allopatric speciation?	It is speciation due to&nbsp;<b>geographical isolation</b>.<br>Ex - A mountain emerging and splitting a population, Continental drifts, etc.
1671363370226	1656929491595	Why does allopatric speciation create new species?	Due to the geographic barrier, the new environment that a portion of the population finds itself in might be different (food, predators, etc). The changing population traits create reproductive isolation, causing speciation.
1671363527455	1656929491595	What is the name of speciation that occures strictly without geographic barriers?	Sympatric speciation
1671363605494	1656929491595	What is sympatric speciation? Just define it.	This is speciation that occurs without the presence of any geographic barriers.
1671363734545	1656929491595	What are the causes for sympatric speciation?	This is speciation that is caused when the mating and the resulting gene flow between populations is reduced by factors such as <b>polyploidy</b>, <b>habitat</b> <b>differentiation</b>, and <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b>.
1671363754436	1656929491595	What is the meaning of the word&nbsp;<b>ploidy</b>?	It means the number of chromosomes.
1671363844750	1656929491595	What is the meaning of&nbsp;<b>polyploidy</b>?	Presence of more than a complete set of chromosomes.
1671364096682	1656929491595	How does polyploidy cause speciation? What is this type of speciation called?	<img src="78876396.png"><br>When the reductional division of a cell does not reduce the number of chromosomes due to some defect, the resulting cell contains twice the number of chromosomes as the original contained. This instantaneously creates a new species (quite common in plants).<br>This is a type of sympatric speciation.
1671364584078	1656929491595	What are some examples of plants that are polyploid?	Seedless Watermelon (triploid)<br>Peanuts and Blackberries (Tetraploid)<br>Strawberry (Octaploid)

1671365229902	1656929491595	What is peripatric speciation?	<img src="57137459.png"><br>It is the reproductive isolation of a population of the species that is on the periphery of the natural habitat of the species.
1671365273520	1656929491595	What is the difference between peripatric speciation and allopatric speciation?	They are hard to distinguish, but one of the factors that need to be kept in mind is that one population is much smaller than the other in peripatric speciation.
1671365389078	1656929491595	What is paratric speciation?	<img src="56813418.png"><br>Two subpopulations of a speces evolve reproductive isolation from one another while continuining to exchange genes.
1671365452141	1656929491595	What are the three main characteristics of parapatric speciation?	1. The mating is non-random<br>2. Gene flow occurs unequally<br>3. populations exist in either continuous or discontinuous geographic ranges
1671365508520	1656929491595	<img src="89367980.png"><br>What kind of speciation is this?	This is parapatric speciation.
1671365549942	1656929491595	What are the two most important models of evolution called?	<img src="53533635.png">
1671365719973	1656929491595	Describe what the gradualism theory of evolutions states?	This is theory that states that change comes about gradually in nature as opposed to large steps.
1671365895851	1656929491595	Describe in brief what the Punctuated equilibrium model of evolution states.	Punctuated equilibrium is a theory that proposes that once a species appears in the fossil record, the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history. When significant evolutionary change does occur, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation, instead of species being gradually converted into another species.
1671366142836	1656929491595	Explain the experiment that Dianne Dodd did with fruit flies at Yale, and what we can derive from it.	Dianne Dodd took an initial sample of fruit flies, and then separated them into two populations. One was put in a starch medium, the other was put in a maltose medium.<br>After several generations, these two population were again allowed to intermingle.<br>It was seen that after they were united, the flies preferred to mate with flies of their own population.<br><br><img src="39068983.png"><br>This showed that under allopatric conditions such as these, the reproductive isolation can begin.
1671367248270	1656929491595	What are the kinds of reproductive barriers? Just Name them	1. Pre-zygotic (before fertilization)<br>2. Post-zygotic (after fertilization)
1671367311172	1656929491595	What are the kinds of pre-zygotic reproductive barriers? Name them (4)	1. Habitat<br>2. Temporal<br>3. Mechanical<br>4. Behavioural
1671367340855	1656929491595	Name the types of post-zygotic reproductive barriers? (2)	1. Gametic<br>2. Hybrid
1671367541301	1656929491595	What is temporal reproductive barrier? Provide an example.	When the members of tho two populations undergo the mating process at different times.<br>Ex - different populations of cicadas emerge at different time intervals, and thus they face a temporal reproductive barrier.
1671367595660	1656929491595	What is mechanical reproductive isolation?	It is a type of reproductive isolation that occurs when the reproductive parts of members of two population are no longer compatible due to some mutation.
1671367681564	1656929491595	What is behavourial reproductive isolation? Give an example.	It is when the mating signals between members of two different species is no longer understood by the other.<br>Ex - Eastern and Western Meadow larks in NYC have developed different calls and songs, thus facing a behavourial reproductive isolation.
1671368738136	1656929491595	What is gametic reproductive isolation?	Due to molecular incompatibility of the gametes, fertilisation can not happen in such cases.<br>Ex - Purple and red sea urchin.
1671373129737	1656929491595	What is hybrid sterility	This is a type of reproductive isolation where the offspring of two organisms from different species is sterile, and thus can not reproduce.
1671373219870	1656929491595	Why are hybrids often sterile?	Hybrids often have different number of chromosomes from different species, and thus the chromosomes can not pair up during meiosis.
1671373496436	1656929491595	What kind of speciation does the case of the apple maggot fly and the hawthorn fly demonstrate, and why?	They demonstrate a case of&nbsp;<b>sympatric speciation</b>. This is because the speciation occurs within the population without the geographical seperation that allopatric speciation entails. They developed separate behaviours or choices that isolate them.
1671373680494	1656929491595	Explain how the theory of Pangenesis explain inheritance of characteristics in living organisms.	Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates suggested that particles call 'Pangenes' travel from each part of an organism's body to the eggs or sperm and then are passed onto the next generation.
1671373728077	1656929491595	Why was the Pangenesis theory wrong?	Because it was later seen (Weismann Barrier) that the changes in the somatic cells of an organism does not affect the sperms and eggs of the organism.
1671373794804	1656929491595	Why is the blending hypothesis of inheritance proven to be wrong?	It is because it can not explain how traits that dissapear in one generation can reappear in the next generation.
1671373820681	1656929491595	What is Heredity?	It is the transmission of traits from one generation to the next.
1671373850437	1656929491595	What is the field of genetics?	It is the scientific study of the field of genetics.
1671373905730	1656929491595	What are true breeding organisms?	A true breeding organism is something that if self-fertilized, gives the same traits as the previous generation, always.
1671374963678	1656929491595	In the Mendelian monohybrid cross, what is the ratio of the dominant gene to the recessive genes?	3:1
1671375224428	1656929491595	What is a homozygous and heterozygous genotype?	When the organism has two copies of the same allele, it is called homozygous genotype.<br>When it has two different copies of alleles, we can say that it is a heterozygous genotype.

1671376019651	1656929491595	State Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.	It states that alleles of two or more different genes get sorted into gametes independently of one another.
1671376111337	1656929491595	What are Mendel's Three Laws?	1. Law of Segregation : The two alleles for each gene are placed in different gametes<br>2. Law of Independent assortment : The inheritance of one genes does not affect the inheritance of any other genes<br>3. Law of Dominance : When there two different alleles, only one is dominant and will be expressed.
1671376278652	1656929491595	What did Walther Flemming discover?	He discovered chromatin.

1671379470639	1656929491595	Whose experiments proved the chromosomal theory of inheritance and suported Mendel's Laws?	Thomas Hunt Morgan's experiments with the fruit flies.
1671381385337	1656929491595	Describe Thomas Hunt Morgan's experiments.	In nature, Drosophilia have red eyes. Morgan noticed a mutation that caused white eyes. He then proceeded to mate a white eyed male with a normal female.<br><img src="93008544.png"><br>He noticed that in this case, the males and the females where inheriting the trait in different ratios. He noticed that the trait was inherited in the same pattern as the X chromosome.<br><img src="76618020.png">
1671381711162	1656929491595	How did Morgan explain the fact that the females never got the white eye genes when he crossed the white eyed male with the red eyed female? How did he disprove this?	He considered that the gene was fatal to females and that they never hatched or died early in development.<br>He then mated a heterozygous female with a white eyed male, and proceeded to get a 1:1:1:1 ratio of white eyed female to red eyed female to white eyed male to red eyed male.
1671381867511	1656929491595	Explain using a punnet square why there were no white eyed females when Morgan mated white eyed males with natural red eyed females.	<img src="83880273.png"><br>Clearly, the gene for the eye color was tied to the X chromosome. When there was a recessive X chromosome paired with a Y (i.e. in the males), that is the only time where the white eyed trait was expressed.
1671387189172	1656929491595	Who was the first scientist to make the connection between genes and proteins?	Sir Archibald Edward Garrod
1671387350179	1656929491595	How did Garrod come to associate proteins and genes?	Garrod worked with patients who had a metabolic disease called Alkaptonuria. Garrod saw that this disease often ran in families, and thus he came up with the idea that the people who had the disease inherited a recessive gene that obstructed the breakdown of Alkapton.
1671387623492	1656929491595	Describe Deadle and Tatum's experiment.	Beadle and Tatum worked with common bread mold. They wanted to see whether they could induce mutations that would make the mold unable ti survive on minimal media.<br><img src="57068039.png"><br>They were able to identify a colony that could not grow on minimal media.<br><img src="94387917.png"><br>They then transferred this colony into two tubes, one with vitamins added to the media, and the other with the 20 essential amino acids. Thus, they were able to conclude that the mold was unable to synthesize amino acid(s)<br><img src="42451403.png"><br>They were able to deduce the biochemical reactions that are required to make amino acids.
1671388043060	1656929491595	What are the three main sources of variation?	1. Mutations : Mutations in the germ line of organisms leads to changed characteristics in the offspring.<br>2. Meiosis : Crossing over in Prophase I or independent assortment in Metaphase I<br>3. Sexual reproduction : The combination of new genetic material from two distinct sources.
1671388094636	1656929491595	What is a gene mutations?	It is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a section of DNA coding for a specific trait.
1671388169468	1656929491595	What are the three kinds of genetic mutations?	1. Beneficial : Creates new variations of the trait<br>2. Detrimental : Truncates the gene sequence to abrogate the normal function of the trait<br>3. Neutral : No effect on the functioning of the specific feature.

1671388410381	1656929491595	What is the interphase in the cell cycle?	It is the interval when a cell's metabolic activity is very high and the cell performs its normal functions. Typically, this phase lasts for atleast 90% of the cell's lifetime.
1671388494647	1656929491595	Describe the dividing mitotic stage of the cell cycle.	Accounts for only 10% of the total time required for the cell cucle. It is divided into two stages called cytokinesis and mitosis. Two daughter cells are formed at the end of mitosis.
1671388558459	1656929491595	Define mitosis.	It is a single cell that divides into two cells that are replicas of each other and have the same number of chromosomes.
1671388603605	1656929491595	Define meiosis.	It is cell that divides into four cells that have half the number of chromosomes. It is good for sexual reproduction and provides genetic diversity.
1671389659747	1656929491595	Name the stages of mitosis in order.	1. Prophase<br>2. Prometaphase<br>3. Metaphase<br>4. Anaphase<br>5. Telophase
1671389889965	1656929491595	Describe what happens in the cell in the Prophase of mitosis.	<img src="55463748.png"><br>Chromatin fibres become tightly coiled and folded, forming discrete chromosomes. They appear as two identical sister chromatids joined together at the centromere. IN the cytoplasm , the mitotic spindle begins to form as microtubules begin to grow rapidly out of the centrosomes, which begin to move away from each other.
1671390218716	1656929491595	Describe what happens in the Prometaphase of mitosis.	The nuclear envelope breaks into fragments and then dissapears. The microtubules extend to the nuclear region, reaching the chromosomes. Some of the microtubules attach to the kinetochore, and others touch the tubules coming from the opposite pole. The protein motors exert force and align the chromosomes along the centre of the cell.<br><img src="43307361.png">
1671390643161	1656929491595	Describe what happens in the metaphase of mitosis.	The mitotic spindle is fully formed, with its poles at the opposite ends of the cell. The chromosomes convene on the metaphase plate, an imaginary plate that is equidistant from the poles of the spindle. For each chromosome, the kinetochores of the two sister chromatids are attached to microtubules from opposite sides.
1671467038422	1656929491595	What is the main conviction that men of the enlightenment era held?	They held firmly that the human mind could comprehend the universe and subordinate it to human needs.
1671467080262	1656929491595	What was god to the Enlightenment era philosophers?	Reason
1671467173226	1656929491599	These acheivements led the Enlightenment philosophers to a new conception of the universe based on the {{c1::universal applicability of natural laws}}	
1671467216837	1656929491595	What were the twin pillar of truth for the Enlightenment philosophers?	Reasin and Observation.
1671467281639	1656929491599	If science revealed the workings of natural laws in the physical world, then perhaps similar laws could be discovered in the {{c1::social and cultural world}}.	
1671467400440	1656929491595	Why did the enlightenment philosophers analyse the institutions of their times? What conclusions did they mostly arrive at by such analysis?	They studied and analysed the political, religious, social and moral instituitions, subjecting them to merciless criticism from the standpoint of reason, and demanded change for the unreasonable ones.<br>More often then not, such an exercise led to the instituition being found to be irrational.
1671467444130	1656929491599	In the words of the Philosphes, {{c2::unreasonable instituitions}} prevent men from {{c1::realizing their potential}}.	
1671467593307	1656929491595	What was the major weapon of the&nbsp;<i>Philosophes</i>?	Criticism.
1671467740523	1656929491595	What did the&nbsp;<i>Philosophes</i>&nbsp;fight against?	They fought against what they thought was superstition, bigotry or intolerance. They also struggled against censorship, and fought for the freedom of thought. The fought the restraints that the feudal classes put on the lower classes. They also sought to secularise ethics.
1671470544516	1656929491595	What did some students of the Enlightenment argue, in opposition to the&nbsp;<i>Philosophes</i>?	They argued that the&nbsp;<i>Philosophes</i>&nbsp;were closer to Medieval Christianity than they thought. They are believed to be mordern because of their negations of the institutes of their time, but in reality they were derivatives of the centuries of philosophy before them.
1671470720421	1656929491599	The Enlightenment phiosphers had lost patience with the philosophy confined to {{c1::definite immutable axioms and deductions from them}}.	
1671470892253	1656929491595	Why does Enlightenment thinking have a negative as well as a postive side?	On one hand, Enlightenment philosophers did not believe in axiomatic truths and the deductions that we can draw from them, believing that we had to observe and reason to arrive at the truth - this was psoitive.<br>On the other hand, they also believed that the merciless criticism of the instituitions of their time was an expression of the "truth" of their thinking, and thus there was a negative critical side to them too.
1671471011392	1656929491595	The enlightment thinkings felt as if there were many forces that were impelling them along, What did they believe to be the way that they could determine the outcome of these forces?	They believed that through reason and science, man could attain a greater degree of freedom and control the outcome of the forces that impel them along.
1671471067657	1656929491599	The Enlightenment Philosophers thought that {{c2::intellectual progress}} was to constantly serve to further {{c1::man's general progress}}.	
1671471163141	1656929491599	The Enlightenment philosophers did not turn to {{c2::Descartes}}, but to {{c1::Newton}}.	This was because Newton's method was not pure deduction and hypothesis, but the analysis of data gathered through experience.
1671472766256	1656929491595	What was specific about Newton's method of scientific enquiry?	His research was based on the assumption of universal order and law in the material world -&nbsp; that order is ultimately imminent in the universe. He trusted the analysis of data that was gathered through experience over simple deduction.
1671472824511	1656929491599	The {{c2::phenomena of the real world}} was ignored by the philosophers of the {{c1::seventeenth}} century.	
1671473046745	1656929491595	Why did Condillac arfue the necessity for a new method that unites the positive and the scientific, as well as the rational?	The Philosophers of the seventeenth century failed to pay attention to the facts and the phenomena of the real world. They elevated single ideas and concepts to the status of dogma, which was a result of the rational spirit dominating knowledge completely.
1671473265929	1656929491595	What conclusion did the&nbsp;<i>Philosophes</i>&nbsp;draw from observing the practise of science?	They drew the conclusion that the synthesis of the "positive" and the "rational" was not an unattainable ideal but one that was fully realizable.
1671480446865	1656929491595	What was the definition of "Reason" for 17th century rationalist philosophers?	For them, reason was the realm of "eternal verities" - truth held in common by man and God.
1671480713642	1656929491595	What the main difference between the idea of "reason" between the 17th century and 18th century philosophers?	The 17th century philosophers considered reason as a set of "eternal truths", but the 18th century philosophers considered reason to be an acquisition instead of a collected of dogmatic truths. They considered it the original intellectual force which guides the discovery and determination of the truth.
1671480958928	1656929491595	What were the two different philosophical and intellectual groups in the 17th century?	1. Rational Philosophy : Founded by Descartes<br>2. Empirical Philosophy : Founded by Galileo
1671481241527	1656929491595	What was Locke's main theory?	He stated that the human mind does not have any innate ideas, that it is&nbsp;<i>tabula rasa</i>&nbsp;- an empty slate. Only through experience, ideas enter it. This lent great credence to the empiricist view, that knowledge could only be increased by extending the senses.
1671535465232	1656929491595	What is the main reason why earth is such a unique planet?	It is because Earth is in a special zone where the temperature and pressure conditions allow liquid water to exist - thus making it capable of harboring life as we know it.<br><br><img src="87121203.png">
1671535599611	1656929491595	Write down the names of the planets in order from the sun.	Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune<br>Pluto is not a planet any longer.

1671536137614	1656929491595	Thermodynamically, what kind of system is the earth acting as with respect to interplanetary space? Why?	It acts as a closed system. It exchanges energy with the sun and space in the form of EM radiation, but there is hardly any significant exchange of matter.
1671536385339	1656929491595	Briefly explain what the most accepted theory regarding the origin of the universe, The Big Bang, states.	It states that roughly 14bya, all mass in the universe was compressed to a single point \(10^9 \text{ kg m}^{-1}\), which then started to expand.
1671536449626	1656929491595	What is the age of the universe?	14 billion years
1671536667872	1656929491595	What were the elements that were present in the early universe, right after the big bang? How were they created?	The only elements present were H, He, and a bit of Li.<br>They was only neutrons after the Big Bang, and due to a process call \(\Beta\) decay, some of them were converted into Protons and electrons. These then formed the first H atoms, which then fused to create He and a bit of Li.
1671536790287	1656929491595	How were the elements other than H and He first created?	The elements other than H and He (and some Li), were created in the cores of the firsts stars. H and He clouds collapsed under their own gravitational force to form stars, whose cores then started heating due to compression. At temperatures around 10m K, nuclear fusion of H and He began - creating new elements.
1671536887014	1656929491595	What was the heaviest element that was created in the first stars right after the Big Bang?	Fe.<br>This is because Fe is the element that has the highest amount of Binding Energy per nucleon - the creation of any element heavier than Fe requires energy input instead of energy release. This makes them energetically unfeasible even in the cores of the biggest stars in the early universe.
1671536910296	1656929491595	How old is the sun?	4.6 billion years old.

1671537255225	1656929491595	How was the Earth formed?	It was formed approximately 4.6 bya, when rock forming elements which were gases in the high temperature solar nebula, condensed into small solid grains as the nebula cooled. The grains then accreted to&nbsp;<b>planetesimals</b>&nbsp;such as asteroids and comets, which then accreted to form the Earth and other planets.

1671542669174	1656929491599	The geologists in the mid-twentieth cenury found that the mantle was further divided into the upper and the lower mantle - separated by a {{c1::transition zone}}.	<img src="82794548.png">
1671542751841	1656929491595	What is the reason that the density of rock changes in the transition zone of the mantle?	It changes due to the change in the compactness and the packing of the minerals that make up the rock in the mantle, not the chemical makeup.
1671542825564	1656929491599	The {{c2::two largest density jumps in the transition zone of the mantle}} is at the depths of {{c1::410}} km and {{c1::660}} km

1671543119502	1656929491595	Discuss the sources of heat in the Earth System, and how they interact.	<img src="82640588.png"><br>The sun provides Earth with heat in the form of radiation. Earth also radiates out energy. The internal heat of the earth is also a source of heat - which draws from the heat that was trapped in the interior of the earth during its formation, and the heat from Radioactivity.<br>All these heat sources balance out the inflow and the outflow of energy from the planet, maintaining and equillibrium that sustains life.
1671543632003	1656929491595	What is the Asthenosphere?	It is the weak, ductile layer of mantle beneath the lithosphere that deforms to accomodate the vertical and horizontal motion of plate tectonics.

1671547008008	1656929491595	Describe the elastic rebound theory of earthquakes.	This thoery states that on transform plate boundaries, the lateral movement of the plates cause the interlocked rocks on either plate to bend and store elastic energy. Once the elastic strength of the rock is exceeded, slippage occurs and the stored elastic energy is released in the form of the earthquake. The rocks return to their original shapes, albeit in a new location.<br><br><img src="45057111.png">
1671547131874	1656929491595	Looking at the elastic rebound theory, it looks as if earthquakes are absolutely periodic, and that they can be predicted to reasonable accuracy. Why is this not true?	<img src="19436305.png"><br>This is due to the facts that -&nbsp;<br>1. The stress release in an earthquake is not always 100%<br>2. The local rock strength may change, resulting in the slippage occuring at higher or lower stress.<br>3. Change in the stress level due to nearby earthquakes occuring.
1671547235554	1656929491595	What is the principle that the seisomgraph uses to measure earthquakes?	It is the inertia of motion of heavy objects. It uses a pen that is made to be heavy. When the earthquake happens, the stand the paper in a seismograph moves, but the heavy pen does not move appreciably because of the high inertia it has.
1671547284401	1656929491595	What are the names of the three waves that occur due to earthquakes?	1. P-wave<br>2. S-wave<br>3. Surface waves

1671552203587	1656929491595	What is the process that is used to determine the focus of an earthquake using the readings from seismometers?	Since P-waves move faster than S-waves, the time difference between their arrivals get wider the farther that we get from the focus. By comparing this interval with known travel-time curves, we can determine the distance of the seismograph from the focus of the earthquake.<br><img src="92996505.png"><br>With three such measurements from three different seismographs, we can triangulate the exact position of the focus of the earthquake.
1671552573787	1656929491595	How is the interior of the Earth explored using Seismic waves? Mention just the important properties that are exploited for such investigations.	The fact that the seismic waves are just waves and thus also undergo reflections and refractions is used to study the interior of the earth using seismic waves.
1671552650174	1656929491595	How are seismic waves used to find where liquid exists in the interior of the earth?	S-waves travel via shearing, and thus can not propagate through liquids. Thus, they form a s-wave shadow zone whenever there is a liquid pocket in the path of the seismic wave. These can then be analysed to locate the liquid.
1671553120009	1656929491595	Explain the formation of the s-wave shadow zone.	<img src="19205488.png"><br>The s-wave can not travel through the liquid outer core as liquid does not have a shear modulus.&nbsp; This creates the obvious shadow zone.
1671553203005	1656929491595	Explain the formation of the P-wave shadow zone.	<img src="77749058.png"><br>The reason here is the way that the P-wave undergoes Total Internal reflection at the mantle-outer core boundary, combined with the way that they are refracted through the core.
1671553261024	1656929491595	What do the notation such as SS and PP represent in the context of earthquake waves?	They denote body waves that are reflected by the surface of the earth, i.e. crust.

1671555088706	1656929491595	What are the main source of heat for the interior of the earth?	1. The kinetic energy stored from the collisions of the planetesimals and other bodies that collided to form the earth.<br>2. The gravitational energy that was released by differentiation of the core.<br>3. Heat released by radioactive decay of unstable nuclei.
1671556620642	1656929491595	How is the internal heat of the Earth mainly transmitted in the lithosphere?	Through conduction
1671556674225	1656929491595	How is the heat transported in the mantle? How does this affect the geotherm inside the mantle?	It is transported through convection, which in theory should homogenise the temperature inside the mantle.
1671556730301	1656929491595	Which geotherm has a lower gradient than the other - oceanic geotherm or continental geotherm?	In all estimation, the continental geotherm akways has a lower temperature than the oceanic geotherm.
1671556879334	1656929491595	Where does the earth lose most of its heat?	It loses most of its heat at the mid-ocean ridges where the magma rises to fill the cracks that are formed when the tectonic plates pull apart.
1671556925913	1656929491595	Which emits more heat, continental crust or old oceanic crust? Why?	Continental crust emits more heat than the old oceanic crust because it has higher amounts of heat-producing radioactive isotopes.
1671557175943	1656929491595	Why is the asthenosphere right under the crust molten and ductile while the mantle underneath is not as pliable?	This is because the geotherm at the asthenosphere temporarily crosses the mantle melting curve - meaning that the peridotite that forms the majority of this layer begins to melt. In most of the rest of the mantle, the geotherm is always below the mantle melting curve.
1671566843802	1656929491595	What is a mineral?	A mineral is a naturally occuring crystalline (inorganic) solid with a definite, but not necessarily fixed, chemical composition.
